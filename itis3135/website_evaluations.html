		<h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
		<section>
		<a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale School of Art</a>
		</br>
		<ul>
			<li>Contrast: Yale Art School's website uses unorthodox and jarring color choices, while the coloring in places makes text very hard to read. The website jumps randomly from color to color, and the unnecessary
			gradients provide nothing of value.</li>
			<li>Repitition: The repitition of the website is suprisingly readable later on, but the top of the page and the sidebar is random and spaced weirdly. Differing box size and shapes provide a very off feeling 
			introduction to the website</li>
			<li>Alignment: The alignment centers around a pillar that is about 1/3rd into the page from the left. This leaves a massive amount of white space on the right, and the navigation bar looking out of place to 
			the rest of the website.</li>
			<li>Proximity: The website is cluttered at times and extremely empty at others, primarily due to having all important information on the very top left of the page. Scroll down and the page begins to feel emptier.</li>
		</ul>
		
		</section>
		<section>
		<a href="https://www.sebmckinnon.com/illustration" target="_blank">Artist Seb Mckinnon's Online Portfolio</a>
		</br>
		<ul>
			<li>Contrast: Mckinnon's clean use of black and white text and background does not feel too drab and basic due to the prevalance of his art work. He does not need a variety of color in the website as his own 
			artwork that he's showcasing will do that for him.</li>
			<li>Repitition: The website uses clean, gridded boxes that clearly divy up the direction and feel of the website. Even with some unevenly sized artwork, the margins between the art provide continued conformity. </li>
			<li>Alignment: The Aligment is perfectly split into two sections; a smaller navigation gutter to the left, and the majority of page holding the artwork. Both are evenly sized, and the text centered to the left
			mimics it being on the left of the page.</li>
			<li>Proximity: Utilizes web space effectively by having a wide margin between the website's text and the central images, not cluttering up the design with a line between the two. The images on the right do not feel
			cluttered as well, as the margins between each are nicely sized and evenly show the borders of the art.</li>
